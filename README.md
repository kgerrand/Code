This repository contains all data and code used in my mini project for my Special Topics in Artificial Intelligence and Deep Learning (SCIFM0002) module, undertaken in my fourth year of my degree in Chemistry with Scientific Computing (MSci) at the University of Bristol.

The aim of this project was to investigate and train machine learning algorithms on given data. The data describe three distinct types of biscuit (digestive, rich tea and hobnob), and how they behave when dunked in tea. I explore using classification algorithms to categorise the type of biscuit based on various variables calculated by considering both the biscuit and the tea, as well as determining a capillary flow rate constant for each biscuit. The performance of the Washburn equation is also evaluated and an alternative machine learning approach is proposed.

All data can be found in [data](https://github.com/kgerrand/DunkingBiscuits_MiniProject/tree/main/data) and their significance explained in [data_explained](https://github.com/kgerrand/DunkingBiscuits_MiniProject/tree/main/data/data_explained.md).
